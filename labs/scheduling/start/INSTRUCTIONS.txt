 Instructions for Scheduling Lab
#################################

1. Define the worker
Create a new class called no.arktekk.training.spring.task.AuctionCounter (or similiar). 
	- Create a method in this class (for example called 'countActions') that calls 
	AuctionRepository.listAllRunningAuctions method and prints to system.out the 
	number of auctions returned.
	Hint: dependency inject with autowiring an AuctionRepository for use.
	- Annotate the class with @Component or make it a Spring Bean in some
	other way

2. Configure scheduling support
In applicationContext.xml add: <task:annotation-driven />

3. Define the trigger
On the method created in step one - annotate with @Scheduled. Make the trigger
fire every 10 seconds.

4. Run application
Run web application by 'Run As:Java Application' on AuctionApp.
Observe loggings every 10 seconds in console windows coming from task.
Note that http://localhost:8080/index.html has a small form for adding new auctions.
